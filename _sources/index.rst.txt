daler dotfiles
==============

`This repo <https://github.com/daler/dotfiles>`_ captures hard-won settings and
tool installations that I have accumulated over time. Using the included
modular setup script, starting from a fresh installation of Ubuntu Linux or
MacOS I can have everything I’m used to – programs and all – in a few minutes.

It doubles as a “batteries included” set of configuration files that can
be used by others just starting out. It includes:

-  :ref:`bash config <bash>`
-  :ref:`tmux config <tmux>`
-  :ref:`vim/neovim config <vim>`
-  various :ref:`tool installation commands <tools>`

If you don’t want “batteries included”, you can select only what is most
useful to you because:

-  the ``setup.sh`` script is modular
-  this README documents everything
-  the config files themselves are documented

Ready? :ref:`starthere`!
