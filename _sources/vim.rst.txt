Vim / Neovim
============

:file:`.vimrc` and :file:`.config/nvim/init.vim` have the same contents.

In the `.config/nvim/init.vim <.config/nvim/init.vim>`__ file in this
repo:

-  ``<Leader>`` is set to ``,``
-  ``<Localleader>`` is set to ``/``


.. note:: 

    **Setting up powerline fonts:** After running ``./setup.sh --powerline``,
    which will install the fonts, you need to tell the terminal to use those
    fonts. Go to Preferences for the terminal app, select the “Custom Font”
    checkbox, and choose a font that ends with “Powerline”.

General features
----------------

Here are the features (and fixes) you get when using this config file.
Note that the file itself is pretty heavily commented so you can
pick-and-choose at will.

-  Lots of nice plugins (see below)
-  Syntax highlighting and proper Python formatting
-  In some situations backspace does not work, this fixes it
-  Use mouse to click around
-  Current line has a subtle coloring when in insert mode
-  Hitting the TAB key enters spaces, not a literal tab character.
   Important for writing Python!
-  TAB characters are rendered as ``>...`` which helps troubleshoot
   spaces vs tabs. This is disabled for files like HTML and XML where
   tabs vs whitespace is not important
-  Set the tabstop to 2 for YAML format files
-  Trailing spaces are rendered as faded dots
-  Comments, numbered lists can be auto-wrapped after selecting and
   using ``gq``
-  In insert mode while editing a comment, hitting enter will
   automatically add the comment character to the beginning of the next
   line
-  Searches will be case-sensitive only if at least letter is a capital
-  Plugins for working more easily within tmux

Shortcuts
---------

Here are some general shortcuts that are defined in the included config:

.. list-table::

    * - command
      - mode
      - description
    * - :kbd:`,`
      -
      - Remapped leader. Below, when you see :kbd:`,` it means :kbd:`<leader>`.
        E.g., :kbd:`<leader>3` becomes :kbd:`,3`
    * - :kbd:`,r`
      - normal
      - Toggle relative line numbering (makes it easier to jump around lines
        with motion operators).
    * - :kbd:`,H`
      - normal
      - Toggle highlighted search
    * - :kbd:`,\``
      - normal or insert
      - When editing RMarkdown, creates a new code chunk and enters it, ready
        to type
    * - :kbd:`,W`
      - normal
      - clean up all trailing spaces
    * - :kbd:`,R`
      - normal or insert
      - refresh syntax highlighting
    * - :kbd:`@l`
      - normal
      - macro to surround the line with quotes and add a trailing comma, making
        it easy to make Python or R lists out of pasted text


Plugins
-------

The plugins configured at the top of :file:`.config/nvim/init.vim` have lots
and lots of options. Here I’m only highlighting the options I use the most, but
definitely check out each homepage to see all the other weird and wonderful
ways they can be used.


neoterm
~~~~~~~

Provides a separate terminal in vim.

`homepage <https://github.com/kassio/neoterm>`_

With a terminal inside vim, you can send text between that terminal and a file
you have open. As described in the “Using R with nvim” section, this lets you
reproduce an RStudio-like environment purely from the terminal.

.. note::

    This method works great to send lines to IPython from a Python script, but
    to avoid issues with indentation, you should start IPython like this in the
    neoterm terminal::

        ipython --no-autoindent

The following commands are custom mappings set in :file:`.config/nvim/init.vim`
that affect the terminal use:

.. list-table::

    * - command
      - mode
      - description
    * - :kbd:`,t`
      - normal
      - Open neoterm terminal to the right.
    * - :kbd:`Alt-w`
      - normal or insert
      - Move to terminal on right and enter insert mode
    * - :kbd:`,w`
      - normal
      - Same as above, but normal mode only
    * - :kbd:`Alt-q`
      - normal or insert
      - Move to buffer on left and enter normal mode
    * - :kbd:`,q`
      - normal
      - Same as above, but normal mode only
    * - :kbd:`,cd`
      - normal
      - Send the current RMarkdown code chunk to the neoterm buffer, and jump to the next chunk
    * - :kbd:`gxx`
      - normal
      - Send the current *line* to the neoterm buffer
    * - :kbd:`gx`
      - visual
      - Send the current *selection* to the neoterm buffer
    * - :kbd:`,k`
      - normal
      - Render the current RMarkdown file to HTML using `knitr::render()`.
        Assumes you have knitr installed and you're running R in a neoterm
        buffer
    * - :kbd:`,te`
      - normal
      - Open neoterm terminal to the right, and immediately activate the conda environment in the `./env` directory
    * - :kbd:`,t1e`
      - normal
      - Same as above, but 1 dir above in  `../env`
    * - :kbd:`,t2e`
      - normal
      - Same as above, but 2 dir above in  `../../env`
    * - :kbd:`,t3e`
      - normal
      - Same as above, but 3 dir above in  `../../../env`



supertab
~~~~~~~~

Autocomplete most things with ``TAB`` in insert mode.

`homepage <https://github.com/ervandew/supertab>`_

This is enabled automatically when the plugin is installed.

python-syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sophisticated Python syntax highlighting.

`homepage <https://github.com/vim-python/python-syntax>`_

This happens automatically when editing Python files.
The syntax highlighting works for example within format
strings, within docstrings, reserved keywords. Happens automatically when
editing Python files.

SimpylFold
~~~~~~~~~~

Nice code folding for Python.

`homepage <https://github.com/tmhedberg/SimpylFold>`_


Use built-in vim commands for folding like ``zc``, ``zn``, ``zM`` as follows:

.. list-table::

    * - command
      - description
    * - :kbd:`zn`
      - unfold everything
    * - :kbd:`zM`
      - fold everything
    * - :kbd:`zc`
      - toggle folding of current block

vim-python-pep8-indent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Auto-indent Python using pep8 recommendations.

`homepage <https://github.com/Vimjas/vim-python-pep8-indent>`_

This happens as you’re typing, or when you use :kbd:`gq` on a selection to wrap
it.

vim-rmarkdown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Syntax highlight R within RMarkdown code chunks.

`homepage <https://github.com/vim-pandoc/vim-rmarkdown>`_

Requires both ``vim-pandoc`` and ``vim-pandoc-syntax``, described below.

vim-pandoc
~~~~~~~~~~

Integration with `pandoc <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/>`_.

`homepage <https://github.com/vim-pandoc/vim-pandoc>`_

Includes folding and formatting. Lots of shortcuts defined, see `this section
of the help
<https://github.com/vim-pandoc/vim-pandoc/blob/master/doc/pandoc.txt#L390>`_
for more.

Uses vim-pandoc-syntax (see below) for syntax highlighting.

.. list-table::

    * - command
      - description
    * - :kbd:`:TOC`
      - Open a table of contents for the current document that you can use to
        navigate

vim-pandoc-syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Used by vim-pandoc (above)

`homepage <https://github.com/vim-pandoc/vim-pandoc-syntax>`_

vis
~~~
Better behavior on visual blocks.

`homepage <vim-scripts/vis>`_

Did you know that by default in vim and neovim, when selecting things in visual
block mode, operations (substitutions, sorting) operate on the entire line --
not just the block, as you might expect. However sometimes you want to edit
just the visual block selection, for example when editing TSV files.

.. list-table::

    * - command
      - description
    * - :kbd:`Ctrl-v`, then use `:B` instead of `:`
      - Operates on visual block selection only

nerdcommenter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Easily comment blocks of text.

`homepage <https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdcommenter>`_

.. list-table::

    * - command
      - description
    * - :kbd:`,cc`
      - Comment current or selected lines


nerdtree
~~~~~~~~

Open up a file browser for finding/selecting files to edit.

`homepage <https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree>`_


Open up a file browser, navigate it with vim movement keys, and hit ``Enter``
to open the file in a new buffer.

.. list-table::

    * - command
      - description
    * - :kbd:`,n`
      - toggle file browser


vim-airline
~~~~~~~~~~~
Nice statusline, plus "tabs" that allow you to easily switch between open files
and copy/paste between them.

`homepage <https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline>`_

Install powerline fonts for full effect (``./setup.sh --powerline``). See below
for themes.

vim-airline-themes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Themes for use with vim-airline.

`homepage <https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline/wiki/Screenshots>`_


vim-tmux-clipboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Automatically copy yanked text from vim into the tmux clipboard.

`homepage <https://github.com/roxma/vim-tmux-clipboard>`_

See this `screencast <https://asciinema.org/a/7qzb7c12ykv3kcleo4jgrl2jy>`_ for
usage details. Note that this also requires the `vim-tmux-focus-events
<https://github.com/tmux-plugins/vim-tmux-focus-events>`_ plugin as well.


vim-fugitive
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run git from vim.

`homepage <https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive>`_

I mostly use this for making incremental commits from within vim. This makes it
a terminal-only version of :ref:`git-cola` or an alternativel to :ref:`tig`.
Specifically:


.. list-table::

    * - command
      - description
    * - :kbd:`:Gdiff`
      - Split the current buffer, showing the current version on one side and
        the last-committed version on the other
    * - :kbd:`Gcommit`
      - After saving the buffer, commit to git (without having to jump back out
        the terminal). ``:Gcommit -m "commit message..."`` works too.

The following commands are built-in vim commands when in diff mode, but
are used heavily when working with ``:Gdiff``:

.. list-table::

    * - command
      - description
    * - :kbd:`]c`
      - Go to the next diff
    * - :kbd:`[c`
      - Go to the previous diff
    * - :kbd:`do`
      - Use the [o]ther file's contents for the current diff
    * - :kbd:`dp`
      - [P]ut the contents of this diff into the other file

vim-diff-enhanced
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Provides additional diff algorithms that work better on certain kinds of
files.

`homepage: <https://github.com/chrisbra/vim-diff-enhanced>`_

.. list-table::

    * - command
      - description
    * - :kbd:`:EnhancedDiff <algorithm>`
      - Configure the diff algorithm to use, see below table


The following algorithms are available:

.. list-table::

    * - algorithm
      - description
    * - myers
      - Default diff algorithm
    * - default
      - alias for `myers`
    * - minimal
      - Like myers, but tries harder to minimize the resulting diff
    * - patience
      - Patience diff algorithm
    * - histogram
      - Histogram is similar to patience but slightly faster


vim-table-mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Easy formatting of tables in Markdown and Restructured Text.

`homepage <https://github.com/vim-pandoc/vim-pandoc-syntax>`_

Nice Markdown tables are a pain to format. This plugin makes it easy, by
auto-padding table cells and adding the header lines as needed.


.. list-table::

    * - command
      - description
    * - :kbd:`:TableModeEnable`
      - Enables table mode, which makes on-the-fly adjustements to table cells
        as they're edited
    * - :kbd:`:TableModeDisable`
      - Disables table mode
    * - :kbd:`:Tableize`
      - Creates a markdown or restructured text table based on TSV or CSV text
    * - :kbd:`TableModeRealign`
      - Realigns an existing table, adding padding as necessary

See the homepage for, e.g., using ``||`` to auto-create header lines.

Working with R in nvim
----------------------

This assumes that you’re using neovim and have installed the neoterm
plugin.

Initial setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When first starting work on a file:

1. Open or create a new RMarkdown file with nvim
2. Open a neoterm terminal to the right (``,t``)
3. Move to that terminal (``Alt-w``).
4. In the terminal, source activate your environment
5. Start R in the terminal
6. Go back to the RMarkdown or R script, and use the commands below to
   send lines over.

Working with R
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have the terminal up and running, write some R code in the text file
buffer. To test, you can send lines over using any of the following methods:

1. ``gxx`` to send the current line to R
2. Highlight some lines (``Shift-V`` in vim gets you to visual select
   mode), ``gx`` sends them and then jumps to the terminal.
4. Inside a code chunk, ``,cd`` sends the entire code chunk and then
3  jumps to the next one. This way you can ``,cd`` your way through an
   Rmd
4. ``,k`` to render the current Rmd to HTML.

Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes text gets garbled when using an interactive node on biowulf.
This is due to a known bug in Slurm, but Biowulf is not intending on
updating any time soon. The fix is ``Ctrl-L`` either in the Rmd buffer
or in the terminal buffer. And maybe ``,R`` to refresh the syntax
highlighting.

Remember that the terminal is a vim window, so to enter commands you
need to be in insert mode.
