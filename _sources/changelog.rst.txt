**vim/nvim; docs**

Update docs and nvim config fallback for Terminal.app users (which doesn't
support true color in the terminal, which in turn breaks many colorschemes in
nvim).

2023-10-11
----------

This finishes the progression of migrating to Lua-based vim config. See
:ref:`nvim-lua` for context, and the updated :ref:`vim` for plugin and
keymapping documentation for details.

**vim/nvim**

- new, barebones .vimrc
- remove .vim dir
- refactor init.vim to init.lua
- use lazy.nvim for plugin handling
- add plugins:

  - indent-blankline
  - beacon
  - nvim-cmp (and various dependencies)
  - telescope
  - treesitter
  - which-key
  - nvim-tree
  - accelerated_jk
  - aerial
  - gitsigns
- modularize config into multiple lua files
- convert mappings to have descriptions, so which-key picks them up
- change how buffers are switched
- removed plugins:

  - NERDTree (replaced by nvim-tree)
  - supertab (replaced by nvim-cmp)
  - simpylfold (replaced by treesitter folding)
  - gv.vim (replaced by diffview and gitsigns)

**vim/nvim**

- make ``init.vim`` more condensed, and move plugin information over to HTML
  docs. This makes it less intimidating to look through the file and discover
  useful bits
- split out Lua-specific config code into :file:`.config/nvim/lua/plugin-config.lua`
- use ``set termguicolors`` to improve the zenburn colorscheme
- vim settings have comments on same line for more streamlined reading/discovery
- generalized comments to say <leader> instead of typing the overridden leader ","
- improved behavior when switching to a terminal in vim: when going to
  terminal, always enter insert mode. <leader>q and <leader>w work even in
  insert mode.
- detect ``*.smk`` as Snakemake files

**bash**

- split ``git-clean-branches`` into ``git-clean-branches-master`` and ``git-clean-branches-main``
- improve ``ca`` and ``conda_deactivate_all`` behavior (check conda is installed first; source the init in ``conda_deactivate_all``).
- only set ``alias vim=nvim`` if nvim exists
- new ``hostlist`` bash function for listing hosts in ssh config

**general**

- tests now run in the docker container using a new testing framework
- a few rounds of docs cleanup

**installation**

- fix Biowulf PATH for mambaforge installation (thanks @menoldmt)
- fix vim plugin installation to not use aliases (thanks @aliciaaevans)
- fix mambaforge complaining if tmpdir exists (thanks @aliciaaevans)


2023-07-06
----------

Updates to support new MacOS and arm64 architecture, and general improvements:

**bash**

- add ``ca``, ``conda_deactivate_all``, and automatic deactivation within tmux,
  as well as new documentation to describe the rationale and how to use

**installation**

- ``--install-miniconda`` is now ``--install-conda``, and uses Mambaforge
  instead of Miniconda3. This sets the conda-forge channel and includes mamba.
  This also now supports all architectures supported by Mambaforge
- various ``--install-pkgname`` commands use mamba to install rather than conda
- ``--set-up-vim-plugins`` now runs ``:PlugInstall`` automatically, and does so for both vim and nvim
- new command for post-installation stuff for mac (``--mac-stuff``)

**vim/nvim**

- nvim config now protects nvim-only configuration so that you don't get errors opening vim
- added recommended order of operations to the top of the help
- add alias for ``start_agent``
- new ``--install-tmux`` useful for Mac
- rm installation options for meld as well as the ``--graphical-diffs`` command
- improved ``start_agent`` function that works well on Mac
- add docs for mac ssh

2022-12-27
----------
Lots of updates to the neovim config, ``.config/nvim/init.vim``:

- The neoterm plugin is no longer actively developed; switched to using
  ToggleTerm and updated all shortcuts and commands
- Now ``,q`` from a terminal doesn't need <Esc> first, making switching back to
  the text buffer much nicer
- Major improvements in the comments in init.vim to make it easier to learn
  what does what, and to improve discoverability of features. This includes
  a brief description of oft-used commands provided by plugins as well as what
  to search the help for in order to learn more.
- Added the "leap" plugin.
- change ``,ry`` to ``,yr`` for better mnemonic of "YAML for R"

Other changes:

- in ``setup.sh``, add an option to compile neovim, in cases where the system's
  GLIBC is out of date (e.g. on older Linux systems) but you want to use the
  latest neovim version

- add ``.snakemake`` and ``env`` to the ignored patterns in the ``tre``
  function (found in the ``.functions`` file)

2022-09-14
----------

- conda setup now sets the recommended `strict channel priority <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-channels.html#strict-channel-priority>`_
- made some fixes to correctly run on recent Mac OS versions


2022-07-22
----------

- updated git repo for nerdtree and nerdcommenter plugins in ``init.vim`` (thanks @njohnso6)

2022-07-09
----------

- added new ``prsetup`` function for working on contributed pull requests

2022-05-27
----------

Changes to :file:`init.vim` (thanks @mitraak)

- add shortcut to add commonly-used YAML front matter to RMarkdown (``<leader>ry``, mnemonic is "RMarkdown YAML")
- add shortcut to add commonly-used ``knitr::opts`` option-setting chunk for
  RMarkdown (``<leader>ko``, mnemonic is "knitr options"
- add shortcut to change working directory of neoterm terminal to that of the
  buffer the command is called from (``<leader>tcd``, mnemonic is "terminal
  change directory")

2022-02-05
----------

Changes to :file:`init.vim`:

- Change ``<leader>d`` to insert a ReST-formatted date title
- ``<leader>-`` will fill the rest of the line with dashes (useful for making
  important comments stand out more)
- ``<leader>md`` to set hard-wrap at 80 columns. Mnemonic is "markdown" since
  this is especially useful when writing markdown. There is a corresponding
  ``<leader>nd`` ("no markdown") to turn that off.
- Set shiftwidth and tabstop to 2 spaces for R and RMarkdown, consistent with
  common R style guides
- The ``<leader>k`` command has been used for rendering RMarkdown; now if
  a file is detected as Python ``<leader>k`` will assume you're running IPython
  in the neoterm terminal and will call ``run <filename>``
- ``<leader><TAB>`` will fill out ``:set nowrap tabstop=`` and then leave the
  cursor at the vim command bar so you can fill in a reasonble tabstop for the
  file you're looking at.


2021-11-09
----------

Changed ``zoxide`` installation to use conda env.

2021-09-18
----------

2021-07-14
----------

Lessons from setting up a new Mac...

- Instead of `.bashrc` sourcing `.bash_profile`, it is now flipped around to
  the more conventional (on Linux) `.bash_profile` sourcing `.bashrc`. This is
  also more convenient when running `conda init bash` which will add lines to
  `.bashrc`. Note that on Mac, `conda init bash` adds the lines to
  `.bash_profile.`

- Added some additional notes about configuring Macs (iTerm2 bell, disable zsh warning)

- Added some additional notes about post-setup (ssh keygen and copy-id)

- Added ncurses explicitly to the requirements-mac.txt. Without this, there was
  a dynamic library loading issue because ncurses falls back to defaults
  channel (not conda-forge). It's possible that using mamba would fix this.

- Removed dircolors from requirements-mac.txt which is apparently no longer available.
