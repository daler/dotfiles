Migrating to Neovim Lua config
==============================

Neovim has been supporting a lot of interesting new features. Historically,
in these dotfiles I've tried to largely maintain backward compatibility with vim
by keeping ``.config/nvim/init.vim`` symlinked to ``.vimrc``. But I realized
that this was preventing me from using a lot of the new functionality.

One of the nice features of nvim is being able to configure with Lua. I've never
been able to get the hang of VimL (the internal vim language), but was able to
quickly pick up Lua since it has a lot of similarities with Python.

It is very empowering to have the full use of a language like Lua to use in
configuration!

I finally decided to take the plunge and convert my vim+neovim config into
a full-fledged Lua nvim config. Now there's only a barebones ``.vimrc`` for
the rare occasions when I need to use :file:`/usr/bin/vim` for some reason.

This page is for those of you who have used these dotfiles before, and might
even have modified your own vim+nvim config...but now with with this newfangled
config you don't know what's going on!

**TL;DR: try out the new version**

To try this out:

.. code-block::

   # Back up old files
   mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim-backup
   mv ~/.vimrc ~/.vimrc-backup
   mv ~/.vim ~/.vim-backup

   # here we refer to the dotfiles repo dir;
   # modify accordingly for where you put it.
   cp -r dotfiles/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim
   cp -r dotfiles/.vimrc ~/.vimrc

Then open up nvim, and wait for the installations to complete. You should be
good to go.

Here are some initial things to try:

- <leader>, and then wait a second. You'll get a menu that pops up, showing you
  the currently-configured key mappings that follow <leader>. Hitting a listed
  key will execute the command. Sometimes you'll see "-> prefix" in the menu,
  which means you can hit that key to see a menu of the things you can type
  after that. If you go too far, use <Backspace> to go back a step.

  In fact, you can hit backspace a few times to get to the base vim commands. It
  can be helpful to look through to see if there's any you've forgotten about!

- which-key also pops up if you use `'` (for marks), and helps you navigate
  between them.

- ``z=`` over a word to get a pop-up for spelling suggestions

- saner tab completion (hit tab until you like what you see). If you run ``:set
  spell`` then you'll get spelling suggestions upon hitting tab; otherwise it
  will pull text from the buffer.

- ``<Shift>k<Shift>j`` (so, hold down shift and type ``kj``) to flash a beacon
  where the cursor is. This also works when jumping between search hits.

- ``<leader>ff`` to open a file selector within this directory

- ``<leader>fg`` to live-grep within the directory (hit enter on the search
  result to open the file at that location). Great for exploring new codebases.

Don't like it? Do this to revert:

.. code-block::

  # aaaaah! revert! revert!
  mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim-lua
  mv ~/.config/nvim-backup ~/.config/nvim
  rm ~/.vimrc
  mv ~/.vimrc-backup ~/.vimrc
  mv ~/.vim-backup ~/.vim

The rest of this page gives some more context so you can make your own changes.

.config/nvim/init.vim -> .config/nvim/init.lua
----------------------------------------------

First, there's no more ``init.vim``. It's ``init.lua`` instead. When you open up
this file, there's very little to see. That's because the config has been
modularized into more pieces.

How Lua finds files
-------------------

When you say:

.. code-block:: lua

   require('settings')

Lua will look in the :file:`lua` directory for a file called
:file:`lua/settings.lua`, and run it. If there's a :file:`init.lua` file in
a directory, you can require that directory without needing to specify a file
name.

Here's `nvim docs on Lua modules
<https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua-guide.html#lua-guide-modules>`_ for more info.

lazy.vim for plugins
--------------------

This config uses `lazy.nvim <https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim>`_ for managing
plugins. I like the design of how it encourages modular plugin configs. This
also encourages and supports keeping the plugin-specific keymappings with the
plugin itself. The interface is also quite nice (though you need a `patched Nerd
Font <https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads>`_ for your font of interest, and
this font should be configured to be used by the terminal program you're using).

The lazy-loading aspect of it is a bonus.

The :file:`init.lua` file
-------------------------

- :file:`lua/settings.lua` has general vim settings
- :file:`lua/plugins/` directory has plugin configs, which are found by
  the ``lazy.nvim`` plugin manager. See :ref:`how-plugins-work` for details.
- :file:`lua/mappings.lua` has keymappings. Note that keymappings related to
  plugins are not configured here but instead in their respective plugin config.
- :file:`lua/autocommands.lua` has autocommands, which are things to run on
  particular triggers or particular kinds of buffers.

Read on for more on each file.

:file:`lua/settings.lua`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
:file:`lua/settings.lua`, is largely a direct translation of VimL to Lua. I just
wrapped the commands in ``vim.cmd()`` calls. Importantly, ``<leader>`` is set
here, which needs to be done before any plugins are loaded, which is why this
file is "require"d first in :file:`init.lua`. Here's `nvim docs on running Vim
commands with Lua
<https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua-guide.html#lua-guide-vim-commands>`_ for more
info.

:file:`lua/plugins/`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:file:`init.lua` runs the ``lazy.nvim`` plugin manager, giving it ``"plugins"``
as its only parameter. This points lazy.nvim to the :file:`lua/plugins`
directory. This directory has :file:`lua/plugins/init.lua` which is run.
``lazy.nvim`` also scans the :file:`plugins` directory for other files, which
contain configuration for various plugins. See :ref:`how-plugins-work` for more
on this.

:file:`lua/mappings`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:file:`lua/mappings.lua` has keymappings. Here, we use the ``vim.keymap.set``
command to set mappings. Importantly, we provide the ``desc`` argument to all of
the mappings. These descriptions are automatically discovered by the
``which-key`` plugin, which shows a pop-up menu after a second or so. It shows
the possible key combinations you can do.

How to add/configure plugins
----------------------------

Does the plugin need configuration? Add a new Lua file to :file:`lua/plugins/`
named after the plugin.

Follow the existing plugin files for a guide, but basically you're aiming for
something like this:

.. code-block:: lua

  return {
    "username/reponame",
    config = function()
      -- stuff here for setup. Might include keybindings or more complicated
      -- things.
    end,
  }
